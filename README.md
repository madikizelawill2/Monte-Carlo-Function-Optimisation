# Monte-Carlo-Function-Optimisation
Monte Carlo methods use random selections in calculations to solve numerical or physical problems. In this project we deal with a Monte Carlo algorithm for finding the minimum (the lowest point) of a two-dimensional mathematical function f(x,y) within a specified range â€“ this is an optimization problem.
